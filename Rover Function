This code sets up a control pin as an output and a button pin as an input. When the button is pressed, the code generates PWM signals on the control pin to control the speed of the motor. The duty cycle of the PWM signals is continuously adjusted based on the difference between the target speed (6600 RPM) and the current speed of the motor, as determined by the readCurrentSpeed function. The calculateDutyCycle function takes the target speed as input and returns the required duty cycle for the PWM signals. The specific implementation of these functions will depend on your specific motor and control circuit. When the button is released, the motor is stopped by setting the duty cycle of the PWM signals to 0.
